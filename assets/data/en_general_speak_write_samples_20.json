          "the biggest motivation behind a four-day school week is cost savings. to specify, the operating costs involved in each school day, such as utilities, transportation services, and cafeteria expenses, may be reduced if school days are compacted. however, according to one study carried out by harvard graduate school, the operating budget cut through chopping one day off the schedule is slight; thus, a windfall and financial pressure reduction should not be anticipated.",
          "furthermore, apart from the economic impacts stated above, chopping one day off the school schedule may also result in a potential decline in students' academic performance, especially for vulnerable groups. without a doubt, students would welcome such a schedule because they would have an extra day of free time to make more flexible plans.",
          "last but not least, the extended school day is also a significant drawback of the four-day schedule. children, especially young children, are physically unable to concentrate on one thing for long periods, and their attention is easily diverted. it is difficult for children to sit in a classroom full time and receive the extra 90 minutes of instruction.",
          "in conclusion, a four-day school week may cut the operating budget to some extent, but the negative aspects practically prevail and can by no means be ignored. money should never be saved at the expense of the health and development of the next generation."

          "first, people pursue economic growth fundamentally to improve our quality of life, yet when the pursuit of the economy is at the expense of people's survival and health, economic growth loses its meaning. when we pour industrial effluent into rivers in pursuit of economic growth and profit; when we release emissions into the air we need to breathe every day; when we invade remote areas that were once wildlife habitats for more industrial land and resources. all of this may seem like a way to achieve a more prosperous life, but in fact, the adverse effects are threatening the survival of the human race.",
